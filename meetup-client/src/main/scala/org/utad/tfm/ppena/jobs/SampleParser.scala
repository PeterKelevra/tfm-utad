Welcome to the <strong>Active Lifestyle Nerds</strong> Meetup community. This meetup was designed to bring out your <em>inner-nerd</em> and introduce it to other <em>inner-nerds</em> around your area---with a slight <strong><em>twist</em></strong>. Let\u2019s face it, the average person in a bar, club, or other common area where people socialize, often lacks the level of nerdism needed to have a good Fire Fly conversation or a discussion of \u201cwho shot first\u201d (it was definitely Han Solo, folks). <br> <br> This group is designed for the person that loves technology, Star Wars, comic books, Discovery Channel, the sciences, video games, or just about anything one would consider \u201cgeeky\u201d, but not necessarily willing to share it with their friends.&nbsp; <br> <br> <strong>This is especially true for you, <span>ladies</span>--</strong>often times the shiest and least willing to admit how into <strong>Naruto</strong> you really are. We want this to be a community where all \u201cnerds\u201d are accepted and given an opportunity to meet with other like-minded individuals. <br> <br> <strong><em>Here\u2019s the twist</em></strong>: <span><strong>Let\u2019s break that \u201cNerd\u201d stereotype and Assemble in non-nerdy locations throughout San Diego and beyond!</strong></span> <br> <br> <span>Ideally, anyone within the age range of 20-40 would benefit most from this group and overall experience but no one will be turned away!</span></p>\n<p>Come have new adventures and meet new friends at ALN!</p>\n<p><strong><em>Stay active, stay nerdy.</em></strong></p>","created":1338360176000,"city":"San Diego","country":"US","localized_country_name":"EE.
